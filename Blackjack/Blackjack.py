#Milestone Project 2 - Blackjack Game
#In this milestone project you will be creating a Complete BlackJack Card Game in Python.

#Here are the requirements:

#You need to create a simple text-based BlackJack game
#The game needs to have one player versus an automated dealer.
#The player can stand or hit.
#The player must be able to pick their betting amount.
#You need to keep track of the player's total money.
#You need to alert the player of wins, losses, or busts, etc...

#Game Play
#To play a hand of Blackjack the following steps must be followed:

#1. Create a deck of 52 cards
#2. Shuffle the deck
#3. Ask the Player for their bet
#4. Make sure that the Player's bet does not exceed their available chips
#5. Deal two cards to the Dealer and two cards to the Player
#6. Show only one of the Dealer's cards, the other remains hidden
#7. Show both of the Player's cards
#8. Ask the Player if they wish to Hit, and take another card
#9. If the Player's hand doesn't Bust (go over 21), ask if they'd like to Hit again.
#10. If a Player Stands, play the Dealer's hand. The dealer will always Hit until the Dealer's value meets or exceeds 17
#11. Determine the winner and adjust the Player's chips accordingly
#12. Ask the Player if they'd like to play again
